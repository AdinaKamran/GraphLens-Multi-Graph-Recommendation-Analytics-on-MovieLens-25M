# GraphLens-Multi-Graph-Recommendation-Analytics-on-MovieLens-25M
 This project builds a full graph-analytics pipeline on the MovieLens 25M dataset, simulating three graph database paradigms (Neo4j, TigerGraph, JanusGraph) entirely in Python using NetworkX. It streams rating data, performs ETL and exploratory data analysis, then constructs large bipartite user–item graphs.
